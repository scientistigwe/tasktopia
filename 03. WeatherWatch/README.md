<h2 id="management-and-development">Project Management and Development Approach</h2>

This project was implemented using the Agile Manifesto methodology. Below are the ways this project adhered to the 4 core values and 12 core principles of the aforementioned method:

<strong>Four Values of the Agile Manifesto:</strong>

- Vision 1: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: **[Sample description]** The Team held [**number of meetings**] planning sessions via **Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams**, ensuring alignment with customer needs and prioritizing features through user story mapping.
- **a screenshot or graphic representation of a Zoom meeting with team members.**

- Vision 2: Responding to change over following a plan: **[Sample description]**: Throughout the project, the team managed (
  [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/github-username/name-of-repository?)](https://github.com/github-username/name-of-repository/issues) + [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/github-username/name-of-repository?)](https://github.com/github-username/name-of-repository/issues) ) GitHub issues, adapting to changing requirements and feedback iteratively.
  **A screenshot of the GitHub project board demonstrates their flexibility.**

- Vision 3: Working software over comprehensive documentation: **[Sample description]** Achieved **[number of story points]** across **[number of sprints]**, emphasizing the focus on delivering functional software increments.
- **A snapshot of the scrum/kanban board tracks their progress.**

- Vision 4: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  Description: Daily interactions on GitHub led to **[number of commits]**, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.
- **A snapshot of GitHub issue discussions illustrates their collaborative environment.**

<strong>Twelve Principles of the Agile Manifesto</strong>

- Satisfy the customer: Held regular stakeholder meetings to ensure alignment with customer needs.
- Deliver working software: Prioritized delivering functional increments in each sprint, allowing for early feedback.
- Welcome changing requirements: Maintained open communication channels and adapted plans iteratively.
- Collaborate daily: Conducted **(frequency of standup) stand-up** meetings to facilitate collaboration and problem-solving.
- Face-to-face conversation: Utilized **in-person and/or virtual meetings (select one or all the options)** to enhance clarity and understanding.
- Motivated individuals: Empowered team members through skill development and recognition.
- Measure progress through working product: Evaluated progress based on delivered functionality in each sprint.
- Promote sustainable development: Prioritized sustainability practices to ensure long-term success.
- Simplicity is essential: Used MoSCoW prioritization and focused on MVP delivery to avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence: Adopted show and tell technique to ensure all team members learn while collaborating.
- Self-organizing team: Encouraged autonomy and collaboration within the team.
- Regular reflection on continuous improvement: Conducted regular retrospectives to identify areas for improvement.

Real-Time Weather Monitoring Application for Construction Site Management

Client: ABC Construction Company

Challenge: ABC Construction faces significant delays and cost overruns due to unpredictable weather conditions. Traditional weather forecasts lack the granularity and real-time updates necessary for effective construction site management.

Solution: Develop a real-time weather monitoring application using Dash, Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide hyper-local, real-time weather data and alerts.

Project Overview:

Objective: Create a robust application that provides construction managers with real-time, site-specific weather data, customizable dashboards, and a reliable alerting system to optimize project management and ensure worker safety.

Key Features and Functionalities:

1. Hyper-Local Weather Data:

API Integration: Integrate with leading weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time data.
GPS-based Data: Utilize GPS coordinates to provide hyper-local weather information specific to construction sites, offering insights into microclimates and sudden weather changes. 2. Interactive Dashboards:

Customizable Dashboards: Use Dash to create user-friendly dashboards that can be customized according to user preferences.
Weather Parameters: Display critical weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, precipitation type and amount, and UV index.
Forecast Data: Show forecasted weather conditions for the next few hours to aid in planning and decision-making. 3. Alerting System:

Real-time Alerts: Implement an alert system to send SMS or push notifications to site managers and crew based on pre-defined weather thresholds.
Example Alerts:
Wind speed exceeds safe limits for crane operations.
Rain probability reaches a certain percentage, requiring crews to cover exposed materials.
High UV index necessitates additional sun protection for workers. 4. Improved Decision Making:

Optimize Schedules: Enable construction managers to optimize daily work schedules based on real-time weather conditions.
Preventive Measures: Allow proactive measures to protect materials and equipment from unexpected weather events.
Worker Safety: Ensure worker safety by adjusting work activities and implementing safety protocols during adverse weather conditions (e.g., stopping work during lightning storms). 5. Integration with Project Management Tools (Optional):

Seamless Integration: Integrate the weather monitoring application with existing project management tools to streamline weather data into project schedules and resource allocation.
Expected Outcomes:

1. Reduced Delays and Cost Overruns: Proactive weather management minimizes disruptions and allows for efficient resource allocation.
2. Enhanced Worker Safety: Real-time alerts ensure workers are aware of potential hazards and can take necessary precautions.
3. Improved Project Communication: Real-time weather data facilitates better communication between project managers, crew members, and stakeholders.

Technology Stack:

Backend:

Django: Utilize Django for handling user authentication, API integration, and data processing.
