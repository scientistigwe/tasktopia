context-aware, intelligent to-do list. Here's how each feature fits in:

Monthly Report: This feature would analyze completed tasks, missed deadlines, and recurring themes in your to-do lists to provide insights into your productivity patterns. You could see trends in your task completion rate, identify areas for improvement, and adjust your approach based on the data.
Notification System: Reminders and alerts would be personalized based on the task, weather, and historical data. For example, a high-priority task with a tight deadline might trigger a persistent notification, while a workout task might be accompanied by a weather-based suggestion (e.g., "Go for a run - it's sunny outside!").
Activity Dashboard: This dashboard would visually represent your daily, weekly, or monthly activity. It could show progress on completed tasks, upcoming deadlines, and task categories that require more attention.
Weather Report: Integrating weather data allows for context-aware recommendations. The app could suggest outdoor tasks on sunny days or reschedule them for better weather conditions.
Recommendation System with AI: This feature analyzes past task completion data and reasons for failure (e.g., lack of time, low energy, competing priorities) along with weather and other factors (e.g., time of day, location) to recommend the most suitable tasks for the moment.
Here are some additional features that would complement this system:

Task Prioritization: The app could suggest priorities based on deadlines, importance, and context (e.g., urgent errands before a meeting).
Habit Tracking: Integrate a system for tracking habits tied to your to-do lists, allowing you to build positive routines and achieve long-term goals.
Focus Mode: This mode could eliminate distractions while working on a task, enhancing productivity.
Benefits of an Intelligent To-Do List:

Automation logic:
To automate the status updates for your to-do list, you could implement a system that combines due dates, current time, and task progress. Here's a potential approach:

Add required fields:

Due date
Start date (optional)
Estimated time to complete
Progress indicator (e.g., percentage complete)

Automate status updates based on these rules:

Todo:

Task is created but not started

In Progress:

Task has a start date and has been started
Progress is between 1% and 99%
Current date is before or on the due date

Completed:

Progress reaches 100%

Overdue:

Current date is past the due date
Progress is less than 100%

Implement a background process:

Run periodically (e.g., daily or hourly)
Check all tasks and update statuses based on the rules

Real-time updates:

Update status immediately when user modifies progress or marks a task as complete

Notifications:

Alert users when tasks are nearing their due date or becoming overdue
