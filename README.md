    - **src/**: Contains all source code files, organized by components, services, and utilities.
    - **assets/**: Includes static assets such as images, icons, and fonts.
    - **styles/**: Houses global stylesheets and theme-related files.
    - **tests/**: Contains all testing files and configurations for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
    - **docs/**: Includes documentation files such as README, user guides, and API documentation.
    - **public/**: Contains public files like index.html which are served directly to the client.

  - **Naming Conventions**:
    - **JavaScript/TypeScript Files**: Named using camelCase or PascalCase to reflect their functionality, e.g., `userService.js`, `MainComponent.tsx`.
    - **Stylesheets**: Named using kebab-case to describe their purpose, e.g., `main-styles.css`, `header-theme.scss`.
    - **Image Files**: Named descriptively and often include size or purpose in the name, e.g., `logo-192x192.png`, `background-hero.jpg`.
    - **Configuration Files**: Use standard naming conventions like `webpack.config.js`, `babel.config.json`.

<p>
    The design of Tasktopia is focused on providing a clean, intuitive user interface that facilitates efficient task management. The goal is to ensure that users can easily navigate the platform and manage their tasks without any distractions. The design principles are based on simplicity, readability, and accessibility, making use of modern web design standards.

<h3 id="color">Color</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Main background color - #f5f5f5 (White Smoke)</strong> - I chose this color because it provides a clean, neutral background that ensures good readability and reduces eye strain.</li>
    <li><strong>h1 headings and nav bar - #333333 (Dark Gray)</strong> - The dark gray color is used for h1 headings and the navigation bar to create a strong visual hierarchy and draw attention to the primary navigation elements.</li>
    <li><strong>h2 headings - #555555 (Medium Gray)</strong> - Medium gray is used for h2 headings to differentiate them from h1 headings while still maintaining a clear hierarchy.</li>
    <li><strong>Paragraph text - #666666 (Light Gray)</strong> - Light gray is used for paragraph text to ensure good readability without being too harsh on the eyes.</li>
    <li><strong>Footer - #333333 (Dark Gray)</strong> - The same dark gray as the navigation bar is used for the footer to maintain consistency and provide a strong foundation for the page.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="font">Font</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Main font:</strong> Open Sans</li>
    <li><strong>Secondary font:</strong> Roboto</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Open Sans is chosen as the main font for its clean, modern appearance and excellent readability across different devices and screen sizes. Roboto is used as the secondary font to provide a complementary style for headings and other emphasized text elements.
</p>

<h3 id="media">Media</h3>
<p>
    Tasktopia makes use of various media elements to enhance the user experience. Icons are used to represent different task categories and actions, providing visual cues that make the interface more intuitive. Images are optimized for fast loading times to ensure that the application remains responsive. Additionally, media queries are implemented to ensure that the design is fully responsive and works well on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

context-aware, intelligent to-do list. Here's how each feature fits in:

Monthly Report: This feature would analyze completed tasks, missed deadlines, and recurring themes in your to-do lists to provide insights into your productivity patterns. You could see trends in your task completion rate, identify areas for improvement, and adjust your approach based on the data.
Notification System: Reminders and alerts would be personalized based on the task, weather, and historical data. For example, a high-priority task with a tight deadline might trigger a persistent notification, while a workout task might be accompanied by a weather-based suggestion (e.g., "Go for a run - it's sunny outside!").
Activity Dashboard: This dashboard would visually represent your daily, weekly, or monthly activity. It could show progress on completed tasks, upcoming deadlines, and task categories that require more attention.
Weather Report: Integrating weather data allows for context-aware recommendations. The app could suggest outdoor tasks on sunny days or reschedule them for better weather conditions.
Recommendation System with AI: This feature analyzes past task completion data and reasons for failure (e.g., lack of time, low energy, competing priorities) along with weather and other factors (e.g., time of day, location) to recommend the most suitable tasks for the moment.
Here are some additional features that would complement this system:

Task Prioritization: The app could suggest priorities based on deadlines, importance, and context (e.g., urgent errands before a meeting).
Habit Tracking: Integrate a system for tracking habits tied to your to-do lists, allowing you to build positive routines and achieve long-term goals.
Focus Mode: This mode could eliminate distractions while working on a task, enhancing productivity.
Benefits of an Intelligent To-Do List:

Increased Productivity: Context-aware recommendations, personalized notifications, and data-driven insights would help you make better use of your time.
Improved Task Completion: The app would guide you towards realistic goals and suggest appropriate actions based on current circumstances.
Enhanced Focus: AI-powered prioritization and a focus mode would help you concentrate on the most important tasks at hand.
Personalized Experience: The to-do list would adapt to your individual needs and preferences.
Reduced Procrastination: Intelligent recommendations and timely reminders would help you stay on top of your tasks.

Weather Table:
weather_id: Primary key for the weather record.
current_date: Date for the current weather record.
forecast_date: Date for the forecasted weather.
condition: Weather condition description.
temperature: Temperature at the time of the record.
current_location: Current location for the weather record.
event_location: Location relevant to the weather event.
user_id: Foreign key linking the weather record to the user.
Forecast Day Table (New Table):
forecast_id: Primary key for the forecasted day.
weather_id: Foreign key linking to the specific weather record.
forecast_day: Number indicating the projected day (e.g., 1 for current day, 2 for tomorrow).
forecast_condition: Weather condition forecasted for that day.
forecast_temperature: Projected temperature for that day.
forecast_location: Specific location relevant to the forecast.

Automation logic:
To automate the status updates for your to-do list, you could implement a system that combines due dates, current time, and task progress. Here's a potential approach:

Add required fields:

Due date
Start date (optional)
Estimated time to complete
Progress indicator (e.g., percentage complete)

Automate status updates based on these rules:

Todo:

Task is created but not started

In Progress:

Task has a start date and has been started
Progress is between 1% and 99%
Current date is before or on the due date

Completed:

Progress reaches 100%

Overdue:

Current date is past the due date
Progress is less than 100%

Implement a background process:

Run periodically (e.g., daily or hourly)
Check all tasks and update statuses based on the rules

Real-time updates:

Update status immediately when user modifies progress or marks a task as complete

Notifications:

Alert users when tasks are nearing their due date or becoming overdue
